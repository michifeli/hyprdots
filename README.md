# Michi's Dotfiles

This repository contains my **Hyprland** dotfiles for **Arch Linux**. I set up this environment primarily for tasks related to my undergraduate studies in **Telematics Engineering** and some work in **cybersecurity** and **programming**.

I hope this serves as a guide for your rice or for anyone looking to replicate my setup. If you have suggestions or additional configurations, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share them, as I might incorporate them into my setup in the future. If you have any questions about how something works in the setup or the tools I use, feel free to post them in the [issues section](https://github.com/sammmDot/dotfiles/issues).

> ⚠️ Warning: Do not apply my settings to your system unless you fully understand what you are doing. Use at your own risk.
